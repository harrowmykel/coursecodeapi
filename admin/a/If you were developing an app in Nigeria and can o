If you were developing an app in Nigeria and can only do one at the time, which one will you design for android or IOS?


With over 41.14 million users as at 12th February, 2016 in the country, android may be the boss of the mobile market but as a developer in a developing country, most of the time, it is not the number of potential users is not the only factor that counts but the number of viable users, users who are have the ability and willingness to either pay for in-app-purchases or purchase the app directly from the playstore and not send from phones to phones. It is needless that the IOS was built for the rich and "the money-havers" which in turn means more money for the developer and android, the masses.
However, whichever one's choice is may be based on how easy it is to learn its language, the number of programmers available or how needed one is in the market and especially if you are building to get rich or to have your application across more users. I will rather be an IOS developer than an android.
